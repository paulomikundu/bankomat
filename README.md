An automatic teller machine has been an integral part of the banking sector. Masses depend on the reliable, user                   friendly, secure way of withdrawl, deposit and transfer of fund.
ATM system facilitates the community to maximize transactions when compared to manual teller machine.
With passage of time, designs and purpose have beeb improvised and we are able to execute a lot of other tasks without visiting branches of respective banks, viz, balance enquiry, lodging a cheque book request , mini statement request, change of security PIN, mutual fund payment.
From my point of view, the ATM system lacks in providing a few facilities that may be added to the existing list of services â€“ emergency cash withdrawl upto 10% of current account balance at two percent interest if paid within 28 days, mobile number updation, addition of extra security PIN , NEFT/ DD processing request lodging, break up for bank loans and eligibility criteria for the same.
This list of facilities would surely facilitate easier accessibility to the working class and the elderly as well ad digitalize processes for efficient working and better consumer experience.
